Hello World, my name is A Cloud Packet!

## What is A Cloud Packet? 

**"Cloud"** is a term used to describe a network of remote servers that are used to store, process, and manage data, rather than using local servers or personal devices. This allows users to access and use the resources of the cloud remotely, as if it were a local network.

**"Packet"** is a term used to describe a unit of data that is transmitted over a network. Packets are typically used to transmit data across a network in an organized and efficient manner, allowing multiple devices to communicate with each other by sending and receiving packets of data.
